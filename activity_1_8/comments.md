# what we learn

- we should create a Vue.app instance in the main.js file
- Within the app we can have data and methods
- we can connect those data and methods using special vue directives like v-model, v-on:click and v-for
- v-model="name of data object" is used to bind the input value to the data object
- v-on:click="name of method" is used to call the method when the element is clicked
- v-for="item in data object" is used to loop through the data object and render the elements

- finally we can use the app.mount("#app") to mount the app to the DOM element with the id "app"
